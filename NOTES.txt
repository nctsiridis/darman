Pagination / Limits:

The app will NOT perform paging. 
If you submit an open ended request such as: github~*/*@*
You are basically saying "any repository" from any source.
Which of course makes no sense.

To avoid these issues we impose the "one query per command" rule

so if you leave an open ended source, then github~*/*@*

will do: Go through all source, if combo supported (github would not) then submit request

One command does at most one request .

so * is not valid for the source, you must specify a source
